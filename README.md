# Fit-Check
This project was inspired by my love for fashion and my own difficulty with wearing unique and hard-to-style items of clothing. It uses machine learning and computer vision 
to detect the colors within an image of clothing, and applies a complementary color tool to output colors that will pair well with the original clothing.
